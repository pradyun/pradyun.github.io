I am generally interested in how existing and new tooling can improve
workflows, and help people use the tooling available to do interesting
and useful things.

Generally, I’m happy to speak for free at community-organized non-profit
conferences that have adopted a Code of Conduct and don’t sport a 100%
male speaker lineup. I love speaking at small conferences but I cannot
afford to pay my way there.
